Once upon a time, in a far away kingdom there lived a rich man, who had three sons:
Simeon (a soldier), Tarras (a fat man), and Ivan (a fool).

And Ivan the Fool remained Tsar over the land. His people lived without money, without laws, and without soldiers, and they had peace and plenty all their days.
